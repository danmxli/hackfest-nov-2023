## Inspiration

üå± As humans, our ability to solve problems calls for a plan that grows in complexity as the task does. Most importantly, a plan must be envisioned for it to become scalable and successful.

ü§ñ Now what if this foundational step were to be automated? By harnessing the power of AI, seePickle gets your ideas up and running by generating a base on which your plans can scale.

## What it does
